# Quick Orientation Map

Use this when you want a **fast, simple read** on:

* what kind of idea space you’re in
* what risks are likely
* how to stay grounded while engaging

If you only remember one tool, this might be it.

## 1️⃣ First Question

> **What kind of idea am I dealing with?**

Pick the closest match:

| Category                          | What it does                     | Main Risk                              |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Practical / Operational**       | helps do things                  | overconfidence, ego tied to competence |
| **Scientific / Explanatory**      | explains reality                 | reductionism, superiority              |
| **Narrative / Identity**          | defines who we are               | tribalism, hostility                   |
| **Moral / Ethical**               | guides right & wrong             | absolutism, weaponised morality        |
| **Meaning / Metaphysical**        | provides ultimate context        | ego inflation / collapse               |
| **Symbolic / Mythic / Spiritual** | nourishes inner life             | literalisation → fundamentalism        |
| **Speculative / Imaginative**     | explores possibility             | fantasy mistaken for destiny           |
| **AI‑Amplified**                  | accelerates thinking and emotion | psychological amplification            |

Naming the space already reduces confusion.

## 2️⃣ Second Question

> **What is this idea doing to me right now?**

Check for:

* calm curiosity → safe to continue
* activation / tension → slow down
* overwhelm, superiority, emptiness, dependency → ground first

If you are not stable, step back.

---

## 3️⃣ Third Question

> **What matters most right now: truth, meaning, belonging, safety, or clarity?**

Knowing what you’re *psychologically seeking* helps prevent hidden motivations from driving thinking.

---

## 4️⃣ Quick Orientation Response

Based on the above:

* 🟢 **Continue** → grounded, curious, steady
* 🟡 **Continue gently** → some activation present, keep grounding nearby
* 🔴 **Pause** → dysregulation, identity fusion, or life disruption present

Pausing is wisdom, not failure.

## One‑Sentence Essence

> **Notice the idea → Notice what it does to you → Ground → Choose.**

That’s orientation.
That’s agency.
