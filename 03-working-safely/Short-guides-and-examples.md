# Short Guides & Examples

This page offers small, human-scale examples that show how to use this guide in real life. These aren’t dramatic scenarios. They’re the kinds of moments where orientation actually matters.

---

## Example 1 — Political Argument Online

You’re scrolling. Someone posts something provocative. You feel:

* heat in the chest
* tightening jaw
* urgency to reply

**Orientation:**

* This is a **narrative + identity** idea space
* nervous system activation detected

**Action:**

* pause
* grounding checklist
* decide consciously whether engagement serves life

Most of the time, clarity returns and urgency fades.

## Example 2 — Existential / Meaning Spiral

You start exploring a philosophical or spiritual idea. Soon it feels like:

* the world is unreal
* nothing matters
* or you might be “deeply enlightened”

**Orientation:**

* This is **meaning / metaphysical** space
* high risk of **inflation or collapse**

**Action:**

* nervous system checks
* return to body, relationships, real life
* consider taking distance

Depth with grounding is wisdom.
Depth without grounding is danger.

## Example 3 — Science as Total Explanation

You encounter a compelling theory and feel:

* certainty
* superiority
* reduced empathy for non-rational perspectives

**Orientation:**

* This is **scientific / explanatory** space
* risk of **reductionism and ego inflation**

**Action:**

* humility reminder
* return to human reference point
* remember: models are not reality

---

## Example 4 — Spiritual Symbolism Becoming Literal

A symbolic story begins to feel:

* absolutely true
* unquestionable
* identity‑defining

**Orientation:**

* this is **symbolic / mythic** space
* risk of **literalisation → fundamentalism**

**Action:**

* recall: symbols point, they are not the thing
* ground in ordinary life
* remain open, humble, human

## Example 5 — AI Deep Dive

You’re exploring ideas with AI and find yourself:

* constantly drawn back
* emotionally amplified
* building strong conviction rapidly

**Orientation:**

* this is **AI‑amplified idea field**

**Action:**

* risk‑assessment checklist
* check identity fusion
* ensure grounding + distance exists

AI amplifies state. Stability matters first.
