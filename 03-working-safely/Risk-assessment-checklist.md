# Risk Assessment Checklist

Use this checklist when you want a **quick, practical safety read** on whether continuing to engage with an idea is likely to be:

* grounding and helpful
* neutral but intense
* or psychologically risky right now

This is not about judging the *truth* of an idea.
It is about assessing **your current capacity to engage with it safely**.

## 1️⃣ Step One — Immediate Self Check

Answer honestly:

* Am I calm enough to think?
* Am I breathing normally?
* Do I feel curious, or threatened / exalted / overwhelmed?
* Could I walk away right now if I needed to?

If you answer **no** to most of these, pause here. Ground first.

---

## 2️⃣ Step Two — Nervous System Risk Level

Which description matches right now?

**🟢 Regulated**

* present
* steady
* curious

**🟡 Activated**

* tense
* emotional load rising
* faster thoughts

**🔴 Dysregulated**

* overwhelmed
* consumed
* frozen, enraged, euphoric, or spiralling

If 🟡 or 🔴 — slow down, ground, or step back.

---

## 3️⃣ Step Three — Identity Fusion Risk

Ask:

* Does this idea feel like **me**?
* Would disagreement feel like an attack on who I am?
* Do I feel superior, chosen, or worthless because of this belief?

If identity is merging with the idea — risk level increases.

---

## 4️⃣ Step Four — Life Impact Check

Is this idea:

* isolating me from relationships?
* dominating attention or sleep?
* pushing me toward emotional extremes?
* reducing my ability to function?

If yes — this idea is affecting life, not just thought. Treat it seriously.

---

## 5️⃣ Step Five — Purpose Check

Why am I engaging right now?

* curiosity
* practical need
* meaning exploration
* emotional regulation
* ego validation
* escape

If the idea is being used to regulate emotion, gain superiority, or escape life — slow down.

---

## 6️⃣ Step Six — Decision Gate

Based on the above, choose consciously:

**Continue**
if grounded, curious, stable, capable of stepping away.

**Continue gently**
if activated but aware, with grounding nearby.

**Pause**
if dysregulated, fused, overwhelmed, or losing real-life balance.

There is no failure in pausing.
There is wisdom.
