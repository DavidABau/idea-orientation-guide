# Grounding Checklist

Use this when thinking, conversation, or exploration of ideas starts to feel:

* overwhelming
* destabilising
* consuming
* emotionally charged
* identity‑threatening

This checklist helps you **return to stability before continuing**.

---

## 1️⃣ First Question: Am I Grounded Enough to Keep Thinking?

Before engaging further with an idea, ask:

* Am I breathing normally?
* Do I feel present in my body?
* Is my attention steady or racing?
* Do I feel curious… or threatened / euphoric / flooded?

If the body is *not* okay, the thinking won’t be either.

If your nervous system is not stable, **pause the idea — stabilise the human**.

---

## 2️⃣ Basic Grounding Reset

Do one or more of these:

* take 3 slow breaths with long exhales
* feel your feet on the ground
* name 3 things you can see
* name 2 things you can hear
* feel 1 sensation in your body

The goal isn’t to erase feeling.
The goal is to return to presence.

## 3️⃣ Check for Idea Capture

Ask yourself:

* Is this idea trying to become my identity?
* Do I feel like I *need* this belief to feel safe, special, or certain?
* Would disagreement feel like personal attack?

If yes, step back.
Identity fusion means clarity is already compromised.

## 4️⃣ Check for Emotional Regulation by Thinking

Sometimes we use big ideas to regulate feelings. Ask:

* Am I thinking to avoid feeling?
* Is this idea giving me emotional relief rather than truth or clarity?
* Am I using abstraction to escape something real?

If yes, gently return to the body, life, and relationships.

## 5️⃣ Reality Contact Check

Ground yourself in what is real and immediate:

* What is happening in my actual life right now?
* What relationships matter most here?
* What responsibilities anchor me?

Ideas should serve life — not replace it.

---

## 6️⃣ Safety Boundaries

It may be time to temporarily step away from the idea if:

* it interferes with sleep
* it isolates you from relationships
* it makes you feel superior or worthless
* it destabilises daily functioning
* it feels addictive

Take distance without shame.
Your wellbeing matters more than any idea.

---

## 7️⃣ A Simple Closing Anchor

Say (out loud if possible):

> “I am allowed to pause. I am allowed to stay grounded. I am not owned by any idea.”

Then decide — *from steadiness* — whether to continue, take space, or return later.
