# How to Use This Guide

This is not a book to believe.
It is a map to help you stay grounded while thinking.

Use it in whatever way supports steadiness, clarity, curiosity, and humanity.

## Simple Ways to Use It

### 🔎 1️⃣ As a lens

When you encounter a strong idea (online, in conversation, through AI, spiritually, politically, personally), pause and ask:

* What *kind* of idea is this?
* What space does it belong to?
* What might be its risks and strengths?

This prevents unconscious capture.

---

### 🛡️ 2️⃣ As protection when overwhelmed

If thinking starts spiralling:

* go to **Grounding Principles**
* go to **Working Safely**

Stability comes first. Exploration second.

---

### 🧭 3️⃣ As orientation for difficult conversations

When someone else is deeply invested in an idea, instead of arguing facts, try orienting:

* What kind of idea are *they* in?
* What function does it serve for them?
* Are they grounded enough for dialogue?

This allows contact without escalation.

### 🧠 4️⃣ As a learning companion

Return to this guide occasionally. Humans do not learn grounding once; we re-ground repeatedly.

## A Note on Safety

If an idea is:

* destabilising your sleep
* consuming identity
* replacing relationships
* making you frightened or grandiose

Pause thinking.
Come back to the body.
Seek stabilising human contact.

Ideas should serve life, not consume it.

## A Gentle Closing Orientation

If you use this guide well, you won’t end up with more certainty. You’ll end with:

* steadier thinking
* deeper humility
* clearer boundaries
* greater freedom

And that’s the point.
