# Common Failure Modes

People rarely get hurt by reality itself. They get hurt by the *ideas wrapped around* reality when those ideas outrun grounding. These are some of the most common patterns.

## 1️⃣ Treating Metaphor as Literal Truth

Metaphors, symbols, and narratives are powerful ways of pointing at meaning — but when someone forgets they are symbolic, those ideas harden into dogma.

**Risks:**

* rigidity
* conflict with reality
* inability to adapt

**Healthier stance:**

> “This idea points at something real, but it might not *be* reality itself.”

---

## 2️⃣ Confusing Intelligence With Grounded Wisdom

A person can be incredibly clever, logical, analytical, or insightful — and still be ungrounded, disconnected from lived life, or psychologically unstable.

**Risks:**

* justifying harmful conclusions
* rationalising delusion
* overconfidence without reality checks

**Healthier stance:**

> “Does this idea make life wiser, kinder, steadier? Or just more impressive?”

---

## 3️⃣ Fusion With a Worldview

When a worldview becomes fused with identity, disagreement feels like attack, curiosity becomes threat, and thinking becomes tribal loyalty.

**Risks:**

* polarisation
* inability to hear other perspectives
* emotional dependency on ideology

**Healthier stance:**

> “This framework helps me — but it doesn’t have to *be* me.”

---

## 4️⃣ Outsourcing Agency to Systems, Gurus, or Movements

Ideas can promise certainty, belonging, clarity, or salvation. When that promise replaces self-trust, agency is handed away.

**Risks:**

* manipulation
* dependency
* moral disengagement (“the system decided for me”)

**Healthier stance:**

> “Ideas can guide me — but decisions still belong to me.”

---

## 5️⃣ Mistaking Emotional Relief for Truth

Some ideas feel comforting. Some feel thrilling. Some feel like relief. None of these sensations automatically make them true or healthy.

**Risks:**

* self-deception
* avoidance of reality
* addiction to emotional highs

**Healthier stance:**

> “This feels meaningful — but does it actually hold up in life?”

---

## 6️⃣ Using System Logic Where Human Wisdom Is Needed

Large-scale logic (political theory, metaphysics, abstract reasoning) doesn’t always translate cleanly to intimate human reality.

**Risks:**

* dehumanising others
* prioritising concepts over people
* moral coldness disguised as rationality

**Healthier stance:**

> “Ideas must serve human life — not override it.”

## Why Naming Failure Modes Matters

When people can name what’s happening, they regain choice. Awareness restores freedom — and that is the foundation of healthy orientation.
